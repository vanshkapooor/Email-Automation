# Email-Automation
The goal of this assignment is to create a Python-based browser automation agent that can be executed from the command prompt. This agent must perform three specific sequential actions related to email handling.

1. Login:
• Log in to the personal email ID.
• The login must use the provided credentials, which should be passed to the agent via
the command prompt.

2. Compose:
• The content of the email must be based on input received from the command prompt.

3. Send:
• The email must be sent to the address: scittest@auditram.com.
Note: Students should send only one email to scittest@auditram.com after successfully
testing the agent.

Execution:-

Once the script is executed, we need to enter the email address to which the mail will be sent (scittest@auditram.com), the hidden password, and the body content.

One more radio button will pop up, asking whether the user needs to create a new profile or use the existing one.

Then the automation will begin in the Chrome browser, and in the order of Login, Compose, and then Send.
